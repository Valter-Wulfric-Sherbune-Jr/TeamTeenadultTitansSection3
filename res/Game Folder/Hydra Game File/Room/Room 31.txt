Room Description:
There are wires coming in and out of the walls to the North and South. The room edges are lined with old legacy technolo-gy. Modems and Routers and HUBs and switches are every-where. There is a large machine that looks like it tests projec-tiles and has a bin of old computers to test. The wall facing away from the machine has bits of technology debris every-where
