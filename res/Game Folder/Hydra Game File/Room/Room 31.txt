Room Description:
Wires reach in and out of the walls to the north and south. The room is lined with seemingly outdated technology, including modems, routers, HUBs, and various switches. A bin containing antiquated desktops sits next to a large machine in the corner of the room, which is apparently designed to launch some kind of projectile. Electronic debris are scattered across the floor on the opposite side of the machine.
