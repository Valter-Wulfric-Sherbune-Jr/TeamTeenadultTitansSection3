Room Description:
Several elongated hallways are present with numbered residential rooms positioned on either side. The passages are interconnected by lounging areas that have their furnishings knocked over. Many of the lighting fixtures that lined the hallways are now inactive, and have had their functions replaced by the emergency lighting stripes situated at the hallway corners that now illuminate the narrow passages with amber light.
